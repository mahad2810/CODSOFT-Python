# Python Internship Submission

## Overview
This README file documents the Python programs I developed as part of my internship submission. These projects demonstrate my understanding of fundamental programming concepts and my ability to solve real-world problems using Python. The tasks include:

1. **Basic Calculator**
2. **Password Generator**
3. **To-Do List Manager**

## 1. Basic Calculator
**Filename:** `calculator.py`

### Description
This program implements a basic calculator that allows users to perform the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

### Features
- User-friendly menu-driven interface.
- Handles invalid inputs and division by zero.
- Allows repeated operations until the user chooses to exit.

### How to Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the file using Python: `python calculator.py`.
3. Follow the prompts to perform calculations.

## 2. Password Generator
**Filename:** `password.py`

### Description
This program generates strong, random passwords with a user-specified length. It ensures that the generated password includes:
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one digit
- At least one special character

### Features
- Enforces a minimum password length of 4 characters.
- Utilizes Python’s `random` and `string` modules.
- Ensures randomness and security by shuffling the generated characters.

### How to Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the file using Python: `python password.py`.
3. Enter the desired password length when prompted.

## 3. To-Do List Manager
**Filename:** `To-Do_List.py`

### Description
This program implements a simple To-Do List manager that allows users to keep track of their tasks. It supports the following features:
- Add new tasks.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- View all tasks with their completion status.

### Features
- Allows a maximum of 10 tasks in the list.
- User-friendly interface with numbered menu options.
- Displays task status as either “Pending” or “Completed”.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

### How to Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the file using Python: `python To-Do_List.py`.
3. Follow the menu options to manage your tasks.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Problem-Solving:** Tackled practical problems by implementing robust Python solutions.
- **Programming Concepts:** Used concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and object-oriented programming (in the To-Do List manager).
- **Error Handling:** Ensured programs handle invalid inputs and edge cases effectively.
- **Modularity:** Designed programs with a clear structure and reusable components.

---

## How to Execute the Files
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Save the program files (`calculator.py`, `password.py`, and `To-Do_List.py`) in a directory.
3. Navigate to the directory in a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run each file using the command: `python <filename>.py`.

## Conclusion
These projects highlight my ability to develop Python-based solutions for practical tasks. The code is modular, easy to use, and demonstrates good programming practices. Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my work!
